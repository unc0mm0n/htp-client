This is an attempt to modify the [Go Text Protocol](http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/) to be competible with the Hecks game created by Maayan Bloom, and to make a suitable client using it for the game's main site at https://hecks.space.

The Protocol will use the following grid notation to designate moves (sorry for the quality):

(Note that indeed, not all intersections are valid moves!)

As well as the Colors "R" or "RED" for the red player and "B" or "BLUE" for the blue player.
